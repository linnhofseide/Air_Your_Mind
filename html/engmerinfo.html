			<h2> Being outdoors is important </h2>
The reason why the app was created is that many of us are too much inside. As humans we are animals, and like other animals we have a natural connection to nature
and being outdoors - yes, although being indoors is usually the most comfortable and convenient for us.
If the app notices that you have been outdoors too little, it will make you aware of this. <br> <br>
<h2> Timing is the thing </h2>
The creators of <i> Air your mind </i> know that you have a life and personal needs that need adaptation.
Therefore, the app's most important app feature is that it takes into account your routines - including school, work and when you usually wake up.
If you let the app know that you have work on Tuesdays between 9-17, the app won't give you a notification telling you to take a trip out on a Tuesday between 9-17. <br> <br>
<h2> Comfort </h2>
Some other important features that the app has is that it is bilingual (Norwegian, English) and has different font sizes,
line spacing and color themes (light, dark, color-blind-friendly). A comfortable user experience is something we place high on the priority list. </p>
